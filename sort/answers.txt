sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: In best case scenario wich is sorted set, sort 1 outperforms sort3 by 2 seconds,
 wich is indication that sort1 is bubble sort because is lower bound is n and for selection sort
  lower bound remains n squered.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: On random set sort2 outperforms sort1 and sort 3 by more than 2
 seconds which is expected given the fact that upper bound for merge sort is nlogn
 and for Selection sort and Bubble sort n squered.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Its running time remains almost same in bestcase and worstcase scenarions.
